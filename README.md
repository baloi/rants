My wife is now talking with my mom about relocating to Texas from upstate NY as
my parents want to come and live here. Texas would be a big change. First, I do
not know what licensing would intail. Next, I am really worried about the kids'
school situation. How will they be in another school? They are really well 
adjusted here. They like it here and have friends. I will not uproot them again.
NY public schools in this area are good. Community colleges like Hudson Valley
Community College is a good alternative 2 year start for my kids. We will just
have to visit other states to see how it really is there.

I am really in between on whether to jump into C++ or just continue coding in C.
C is not object oriented but there is something to be said about its simplicity
and availability in a lot of architectures. Architecture though is not a problem
for me at this time. Simplicity though is really what I like about it. Being non
object oriented makes me think a little bit. I have some experience with C++ and
am learning about templates already, but even creating classes in using them in
C++ is not yet too natural for me. C++ seems to be not to "natural" to program
in. I have looked into Rust programming too. It is nice as it has low level
capabilities like C with more safety and has functional programming constructs,
but the learning curve is a little steep for me at this time. With my time cons-
traints, I am not ready to invest too much time into learning a new programming
language. I would rather spend the time working on projects and problems that
interest me like:

- making my own editor
- implementing a web server
- implementing a database management system (simple)
- processing work data through my own made tools - Python

So this is it. My only use for C++ would be game programming for now with SDL.
Rust I cannon even install in my Mac.

C rocks because of support, available code I can study, efficiency, stability
and simplicity. It just wins.

Python rocks as I can get ideas in my head into code quickly. I have proven this
with two projects already:

1. afternoon made grading system
2. 2 - 3 week free time made excel data crunching program to parse therapist
   caseloads which I am still continuing to develop to have web functionality.

With Ruby, I have not had a single successful project. To much buzz, hype and 
distraction. Although there are very good projects out there. The end keyword to
close scope bugs my visual scanning a bit. Python's code form is much easier to
read.

The book "Learn C the Hard Way" shows how a very good veteran coder is doing 
stuff in C no less. 

C rocks. Python rocks. Now back to coding in C.
