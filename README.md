(Taken from a journal entry)

Studying algorithms, datastructures, files, input-output and databases is a 
challenging endeavour. I hope to be able to delve more into these areas and it
seems that my preconception that studies into these areas are reaching a plateau
is not a fact. What I'm finding more is that there is some more focus back into
low-level programming, better algorithms, better input and output. I used to
think that having more powerful hardware every year would cancel out the need
for efficient datastructures, speed of programs, better algorithms, etc. 

I thought that memory allocation, file access speeds, pooling of resources did
not count anymore. On the contrary, some important work is going on in areas as
we are handling more data with increased need for speed, availability, fault
tolerance and the such. In this regard, I also see lower-level programming
languages like C or newer ones like Rust and Go are on the surge and not only
higher level langauges like Python and Ruby.

Studying and practicing C, would then still be very practical nowadays and it 
becomes more enjoyable once you learn how to handle memory and stuff. A very
good way I found out of learning is to study other people's code and evan to
just rewrite it, modify and run it yourself.

This is now a new endeavor for me. It will definitely replace chess Friday
nights and weekends.

Winter is coming up. I'm also longing to get into cross country skiing and 
maybe tennis more - but cross country skiing I would really like to do more.
I need to keep working at this pace to be able to provide for my family and to
be able to get some recreation for everyone. This is the plan. God help me 
prosper in Your promise land. Thank you for all the Blessings.

Slept soundly after.

C++ may just add more complexity to my mind and force me to multi-task. So 3
things:

1. Code in C (database with editor support)
2. Code in Python caseload project
   - SQLAlchemy models
   - add web support
3. Webserver in C

MAYBE: SDL game prog in C++ or Algorithms (these 2 are a distant maybe)

Will do these until end of December. January I will regroup.

Another entry for today. Going for a kettlebell workout and then work go to work
at an earlier time today.

DAY 1, 21 day KB

* 30 sec swings / 30 sec rest  14    23 s
* 30 sec swings / 30 sec rest  12 3  20 s
* 30 sec swings / 30 sec rest  13    20 s
* 30 sec swings / 30 sec rest  12    22 s
* 30 sec swings / 30 sec rest  11    20 s 

Right now, the forearms tiring is the issue. Got to have a more relaxed grip for
the swings.

My wife is now talking with my mom about relocating to Texas from upstate NY as
my parents want to come and live here. Texas would be a big change. First, I do
not know what licensing would intail. Next, I am really worried about the kids'
school situation. How will they be in another school? They are really well 
adjusted here. They like it here and have friends. I will not uproot them again.
NY public schools in this area are good. Community colleges like Hudson Valley
Community College is a good alternative 2 year start for my kids. We will just
have to visit other states to see how it really is there.

I am really in between on whether to jump into C++ or just continue coding in C.
C is not object oriented but there is something to be said about its simplicity
and availability in a lot of architectures. Architecture though is not a problem
for me at this time. Simplicity though is really what I like about it. Being non
object oriented makes me think a little bit. I have some experience with C++ and
am learning about templates already, but even creating classes in using them in
C++ is not yet too natural for me. C++ seems to be not to "natural" to program
in. I have looked into Rust programming too. It is nice as it has low level
capabilities like C with more safety and has functional programming constructs,
but the learning curve is a little steep for me at this time. With my time cons-
traints, I am not ready to invest too much time into learning a new programming
language. I would rather spend the time working on projects and problems that
interest me like:

- making my own editor
- implementing a web server
- implementing a database management system (simple)
- processing work data through my own made tools - Python

So this is it. My only use for C++ would be game programming for now with SDL.
Rust I cannot even install in my Mac.

C rocks because of support, available code I can study, efficiency, stability
and simplicity. It just wins.

Python rocks as I can get ideas in my head into code quickly. I have proven this
with two projects already:

1. afternoon made grading system
2. 2 - 3 week free time made excel data crunching program to parse therapist
   caseloads which I am still continuing to develop to have web functionality.

With Ruby, I have not had a single successful project. To much buzz, hype and 
distraction. Although there are very good projects out there. The end keyword to
close scope bugs my visual scanning a bit. Python's code form is much easier to
read.

The book "Learn C the Hard Way" shows how a very good veteran coder is doing 
stuff in C no less. 

C rocks. Python rocks. Now back to coding in C.
